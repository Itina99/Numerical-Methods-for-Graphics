    "### Conditions to Obtain a Bernstein Basis from a B-spline Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain a **Bernstein basis** from a B-spline basis, the following conditions must be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clamped Knot Vector**: The knot vector must be clamped with multiplicities of \\( p+1 \\) (where \\( p \\) is the degree) at both ends.\n",
    "2. **Single Interval**: The B-spline should span a single interval, typically \\([0, 1]\\), with only two distinct knot values (e.g., \\([0, 0, .... , 1, 1, ....]\\)).\n",
    "3. **Degree Match**: The degree \\( p \\) of the B-spline corresponds to the degree of the Bernstein polynomials.\n",
    "4. **Partition of Unity**: The resulting basis functions must satisfy the properties of Bernstein polynomials, including normalization over \\([0, 1]\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "When these conditions are satisfied, the B-spline basis functions become equivalent to Bernstein basis functions, enabling representation as Bézier curves.\n",
    "\n"

    "1. **Insufficient Interior Knots**:\n",
    "   - The number of interior knots is too small to properly define independent basis functions for the given degree.\n",
    "   - This leads to a collapse of the spline space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fixed Configuration**:\n",
    "   - All basis functions collapse into a fixed configuration.\n",
    "   - Typically, this results in a constant or degenerate representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Plot Behavior**:\n",
    "   - The basis functions remain unchanged when \\(p > n\\), regardless of further increases in \\(p\\).\n",
